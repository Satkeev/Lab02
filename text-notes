### Headings
  
><h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>  
HTML has six "levels" of headings:  
<h1> is used for main headings  
<h2> is used for subheadings  
If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on...  
Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes.    
The contents of an <h1> element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6> element is the smallest.   
The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly.   
Users can also adjust the size of text in their browser. You will   
see how to control the size of text, its color, and the fonts used words

### ParagraPHs
><p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences   that form a self-contained unit of discourse.   
The   start of a paragraph is indicated by a new   line.  
</p> <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up   into units of text. For example, a book may have      
chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under   each heading there will be one or more   paragraphs.</p>   

 ### Line breaks
 
 ><p>Venus is the only planet that rotates   clockwise.</p> <hr /> <p>Jupiter is bigger than all the other planets   combined.  
 </p> chapter-02/horizontal-rules.htmlH tMl  
ReSult  
><p>The Earth<br />gets one hundred tons heavier   every day<br />due to falling space dust.  
</p> chapter-02/line-breaks.htmlH tMl  
ReSult  
<hr />  
To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you   
can add a horizontal rule between sections using the <hr /> tag.  
There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag.   
They are known as empty elements and they are written differently.  
An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty   
element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. Some web page authors miss this out but  
it is a good habit to get into.
<br />  
As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line.   
But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag <br />.

## External CSS

<<link>  
The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the   
CSS file used to style the page. It is an empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag),   
and it lives inside the <head> element. It should use three attributes:  
href This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a folder called css or styles).  
type This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.  
rel This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to.   
The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.  
An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet. To do this it could have  
a <link> element for every CSS file it uses. For example, some authors use one  
CSS file to control the presentation (such as fonts and colors) and a second to control the layout.
